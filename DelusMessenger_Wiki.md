## 🔐 Security Model

DelusMessenger uses:

- **REChain Identity Layer** for authentication.
- **AES-256 + RSA Hybrid Encryption** for secure messaging.
- **Local-only Storage** for messages (optional REChain-Storage integration).
- **No centralized backend** — messages are routed through a P2P REChain protocol.
